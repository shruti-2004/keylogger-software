# keylogger-software

Keyloggers, short for keystroke loggers, are software or hardware designed to record every keystroke made on a computer keyboard. Although they can be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employees' computer usage in a company or recovering lost data, they are often associated with malicious activities, such as stealing passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information without the user's consent.
